# Method creation syntax:

def funct1():
    print("My first programss")
    print(" rowdy")
print("Sample lines for testing the printing where this particular line of code is not in the order")


# syntax to call a method in python
# syntax: methodname()
funct1()


#The issue in the above program is with the indentation of the print statements inside
# the funct1() function. In Python, indentation is critical to indicate which code
# belongs to a function or loop. The print statements inside funct1() should be
# indented properly to be considered part of the function's body.

# Explanation:
# The print("My first program") and print(" rowdy") are inside the funct1() function, so they should be indented by one level (typically 4 spaces or a tab).
# The line print("Sample lines for testing the printing where this particular line of code is not in the order") is outside the function, so it does not need any indentation.
